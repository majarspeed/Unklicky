# Unklicky z V3

# Updates and additions 
Added a 5mm pin for using a 5mm steel pin. 
Added a 4mm threaded pin for use with a 4 mm carriage bolt or hexbolt. 
Printed the one I tested at .15 layer height. should be fine at .2. 


# V3 major change
![z3](https://github.com/majarspeed/Unklicky/raw/main/pictures/Heatset_contact.png "z3")

Moved the bottom magnet inside the body to allow it to be closer to provide more lift. 
Changed the contact to not require a wire wrap. Now the heatset will contact to the contact screw directly. 
Wire is securured under the screw now to make a cleaner method of securing. 
There is a slot to stop the heatset you will feel it bump when it is deep enough.
The new magnet locations have increased the spring to around a 245 grams of lifiting force. (this is using my finger and a scale take with a grain of salt) But this is about 150% increase from the v1.

There has been a script created to test the noozle ooze that can be used for any probes and endstops.  But do want to thank Jkwang for a great new tool. You can grab it from his github at https://github.com/johnnykwwang/3dp_notes/tree/main/auto_z_accuracy_test.
