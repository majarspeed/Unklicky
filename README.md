# Update 3/30/22
added a alpha release under BFP
This is a 6x3 unklicky probe. Thanks go to JosAR for all the hard work and testing.

With the D-shaped shaft make sure there is no elephant foot to interfere wiht the motion. 
we have found for the wire to to the PIN/stalk it does seem to work better with a bare wire. 
Please feel free to reach out if you have any issues.

First this is all based on an additional option to be used with the Klicky mod. This is not a replacement just an alternative to test the longevity of a mag based spring in a probe. This is actually version 2. I have made a previous version that was normally open. While it worked. It would not allow all the wonderful safety based work that has been done on the klicky to work as intended. 

Please support his project and all the hard work he has done and is continuing to do.

I am looking for feedback on the design. As I do not feel even though it works well for me a test of 1 is sufficient. 

It uses (2) magnet sizes. The standard 6x3 magnets as the klicky on the main body in all the normal locations. But uses a miniscule 3X2 magnet in the stalk. I know it's yet another magnet size. But it was the only way to keep the same foot print and keep it as a drop-in replacement.

# Printing 
There is only one thing. I have found so far is that the wire holes have to be so close to the edge. You need to turn on overlapping perimeter in susperslicer to keep the top together.

Wiring the stalk is not hard but is not super intuitive. Strip more wire than you will need. Feed the wire down with the magnet hole turned to the right. Then back up the other side.

Then I have been folding it back to the main wire making a single loop then snipping off the excess.

Then you can run the wire up to either magnet on the front. A second wire will be run from the front screw to the opposite magnet. 

Ensure the magnet on the stalk is set to repel from the rear single magnet on top. Ensure that the stalk slides in and out easily including with the screw installed. And that the screw is through the stalk but does not hit the rear wall I believe I am using a 12 mm screw.
