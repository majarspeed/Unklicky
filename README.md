Also keep in mind that klicky is based off the original work done over at Annex Engineering the excellent work that was done with the quickdraw probe. 
Thanks for calling this out. I did know the original was based on their work but it slipped my mind. They have an excellent group that does a lot of good things for the community. Support them in there work and thanks for keeping me honest here guys.

Klicky is also based on [Euclid](https://www.euclidprobe.com/).

Thanks go to JosAR again for all the hard work and testing, please support his project and all the hard work he has done and is continuing to do.

This is a 6x3 unklicky probe, it's a mod developed by me and JosAr.

With the D-shaped shaft make sure there is no elephant foot to interfere with the motion. 
we have found for the wire to to the PIN/stalk it does seem to work better with a bare wire. 
Please feel free to reach out if you have any issues. 


# But how does it work!! 
There has been a lot of questions around this. So hopefully I can shed some light. 
The Probe uses an internal magnet on top of the pin/stalk. This magnet is not part of the circuit it is only used to provide a spring for the the probe. 

The real part of the probing is actually done by the screw. 
There is a contact point between the screw and the wire. This allows the unklicky to be normally closed.

# But how well does it work!! 

Measurements were at 240 hotend, 95 bed, 55 chamber, on a Z belted [Tiny-M](https://github.com/gsl12/Tiny-M).
10k probe accuracy tests with 5 touches each. 
In the sense distance you can see the heatup at the start. And the consistency once up to temp.

Besides being one of the most precise switch's of the microswitch shootout (which will have soon a dedicated repository by JosAr), it withstood 50000 probes at 3mm/s
